# MicroFlix/docker/docker-compose.prod.yml
# Override file for when deployed in EC2 (to override certain fields)
# This file only applies in the CLOUD (EC2).
# It tweaks a few things on top of docker-compose.yml.

services:
  # --- Discovery server  ---
  discovery:
    # In prod it's often internal-only; if you want to see the UI from internet, keep this:
    ports:
      - "8761:8761"
    restart: unless-stopped


  # --- Gateway (API entry) ---
  gateway:
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      # Use a 'prod' profile if you add it later
      # SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE: prod


  # --- User service ---
  user-service:
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      # SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE: prod
    # In prod you usually don't expose microservices directly.
    # They are reached via gateway. So we clear 'ports' to keep them internal:
    ports: []   # override and clear any port mappings; still reachable on the internal Docker network by name


  # --- Movie service ---
  movie-service:
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      # SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE: prod
    ports: []   # override and clear any port mappings; still reachable on the internal Docker network by name


  # --- Rating service ---
  rating-service:
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      # SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE: prod
    ports: []   # override and clear any port mappings; still reachable on the internal Docker network by name


  # --- Databases (user/movie/rating) ---
  user-db:
    restart: unless-stopped
    # No public port exposure; only services in Docker network talk to it
    ports: []   


  movie-db:
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports: []   


  rating-db:
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports: []   


  # --- Frontend (only public entry point we really need) ---
  frontend:
    restart: unless-stopped
    # In prod we want "normal" web port 80
    ports:
      - "80:3000"
